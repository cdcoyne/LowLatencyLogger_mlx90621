# LowLatencyLogger_mlx90621
Arduino sketch adapted from [Bill Greiman's SDFat library](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) LowLatencyLogger example modified for Melexis MLX90621 16x4 infrared thermal sensor

I used it with the [Adafruit feather Adalogger M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2796).

Also added is the provision for using a physical switch instead of the serial terminal.
