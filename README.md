# LowLatencyLogger_mlx90621
Arduino sketch adapted from [Bill Greiman's SDFat library](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) LowLatencyLogger example modified for [Melexis MLX90621 16x4 infrared thermal sensor](https://www.melexis.com/en/product/MLX90621/Far-Infrared-Sensor-Array-High-Speed-Low-Noise)

I used it with the [Adafruit feather Adalogger M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2796).

Also added is the provision for using a physical switch instead of the serial terminal to start and stop recordings.

Here is an example usage
